# libft

Welcome to the libft project repository by malescordia.

## Overview
libft is the cornerstone project at 42, requiring students to create a custom C library containing essential functions. The goal is to provide a foundation for future projects by implementing common functions that are not part of the standard C library. This project emphasizes code reusability, efficiency, and a deeper understanding of C programming.

## Project Highlights
- Implements a custom library with fundamental C functions.
- Provides functions for string manipulation, memory management, and more.
- Serves as a foundation for various 42 projects.
- Written in C as part of the 42 curriculum.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/malescordia/libft.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd libft`
3. Compile the library: `make`
4. Link the library to your project by including `libft.h` and using the desired functions.

Enjoy the power of your custom library with Libft!
